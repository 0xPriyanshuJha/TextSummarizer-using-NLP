# TextSummarizer-using-NLP

This program is helpful to summarize large texts or paragraph into a short summary using natural language processing method.

# Modules Used:
1. NLTK - natural language text editing

2. nltk.corpus for stopwords:
The nltk.corpus package defines a collection of corpus reader classes, which can be used to access the contents of a diverse set of corpora.

3. nltk.tokenize:
NLTK contains a module called tokenize() which further classifies into two sub-categories: Word tokenize: We use the word_tokenize() method to split a sentence into tokens or words. Sentence tokenize: We use the sent_tokenize() method to split a document or paragraph into sentences.


# How to run this:
Just import nltk (if not installed then pip install nltk) and download nltk stopwords using import nltk method to get rid from the possible errors
